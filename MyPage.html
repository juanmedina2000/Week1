 <blockquote> "I said something like, 'Find someone who looks at you the way my wife looks at me.' And then I gave her some s*** in the thing and said, 'But I love you. I'm so thankful for my wife—she gave me a beautiful, healthy daughter," Pratt recalled. "Then a bunch of articles came out and said, 'That's so cringeworthy. I can't believe Chris Pratt would thank her for a healthy daughter when his first child was born premature. That's such a dig at his ex-wife.' And I'm like, That is f***ed up. My son's gonna read that one day. He's nine. And it's etched in digital stone."
Pratt and Schwarzenegger are parents to two young daughters. He shares son Jack with his ex-wife Anna Faris.
